//! Basic utilities for the crypto crates.
//!
//! The functions contained here are not really intended to be used by end users, but you
//! are welcome to do so if you wish.
//!
//! That said, beware that this crate is not necessarily documented to the same standard as other crates.
//! Since many of the contained helpers are security-critical (such as the constant time module),
//! we will prioritize fixing security bugs over maintaining a stable API for this crate.
//!
//! This crate intentionally does not have `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]` because some of the constant-time
//! and zeroization techniques require unsafe code in order to force the compiler into specific
//! assembly-level behaviours. The idea is to contain the unsafe code in a central location rather
//! so that the higher-level primitives can stick to safe rust.
